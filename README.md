|1|[ROI, CAC, CR Business Metriks](https://github.com/runaevalina/Portfolio/blob/main/ROI%2C%20CAC%2C%20CR.ipynb)|Data analysis from ProcrastinatePRO+. Various metrics were calculated and cohort analysis was used: LTV, CAC, Retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU, etc.|The USA is significantly ahead of other countries in terms of the number of users and the cost of attracting them.advertising to attract users did not pay off. The reason for the company's losses lies in high advertising costs in the United States, which does not lead to the emergence of regular customers. The problem is that the retention of paying users from the US is low, worse than others. And it began to decline when the cost of attracting CAS jumped up sharply at the beginning of the period under review.Users who came from the TipTop and FaceBoom channels did not pay off due to high advertising costs.|Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, Seaborn, court analysis, product metrics, unit economics|
|2|[Dating site AB-test](https://github.com/runaevalina/Portfolio/blob/main/Dating_site_AB-test.ipynb)|Analysis whether the innovation makes sense among any specific user groups.|Despite the fact that the tests showed stat. significance in terms of growth of the average bill among paying users; the conversion rate from registration to purchase of the premium version is identical to that of the control groups.The subscription price has probably been increased. People are interested in a premium product, but new payment methods do not motivate them to buy. If we “roll out” innovations, then for representatives of gender 1 aged 21-40 years in the following countries: Australia, Belgium, Israel, Spain, Italy, UAE. It is worth noting that users from Latvia and Mexico appeared in the test group.|Pandas, Python, Seaborn, AB-test|
|3|[Metrics improvement in Test group](https://github.com/runaevalina/Portfolio/blob/main/Final_project_AB.ipynb)|Check if testing changes associated with the implementation of an improved recommendation system|It is impossible to correctly evaluate the test results. During the adjustment of the data to the requirements in the technical specifications, the power of the test was reduced, the number of users in the groups was also not equal, in the event data we did not have results for the 5 allotted days at the end of the experiment, users were present. who fell into both groups. In addition, the test was carried out during the New Year holidays and before them, during a marketing campaign, the degree of influence of which on users is difficult to assess.the significance of the difference in conversions between groups was statistically confirmed only at the product_page stage - conversion to viewing product cards.The mechanics of selecting groups should be changed to take into account the likelihood of deleting users as a result of data cleaning, especially if the test takes place in parallel with other company activities aimed at user behavior.|Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, Seaborn, AB-test|
